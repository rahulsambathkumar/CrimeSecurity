                  Crime a major social and economic issue in the United States. The direct cost of crime was
                  estimated to be approximately 200 billion USD in 1993 (Miller et all (1993)). Meanwhile, the federal
                  government was estimated to spend 74 billion USD in 1990 on the criminal justice system, with 32 billion USD
                  earmarked for police protection alone (Levitt (1997)).

                  Becker (1968) was a seminal contribution in addressing the issues of criminal behaviour and
                  sanctions. However studies following Becker were unable to estimate the effect of
                  police force on crime.

                  Studies faced the problem of police hiring being influenced by crime, i.e. increased crime rates could have led to
                  higher police staffing. Levitt's aim in this paper is to break the problem of endogeneity through intrumental variables approach.

              <li>
                Cohen(1988) and Miller et al (1993) attempted to estimate the cost of crime and quality of life reductions due to pain and suffering,
                calculating social cost of violent crimes as approximately $60,000 (1992 dollars).
              </li>
              <br>
              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
                Estimated elasticity of violent crime with respect to sworn officers evaluated at the sample mean translates into a
                reduction of between 3.2 to 7.0 reported violent crimes and 1.6 to 12.4 reported property crimes per additional police officer.
                <br><br>
                $$ \Rightarrow ~ SB =  3.2 * \$ 60,000 + 1.6 * \$1,100 \approx \$ 200,000 $$

              <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">
                Social Costs of hiring an additional police officer based on the average salary equals approximately $40,000
                (Donohue and Siegelman (1994)), and non-salary overhead costs of roughly equal amount. However as Levitt highlights,
                the true social cost may be understated due to presence of deadweight losses caused by tax distortions and increasing prison costs.
